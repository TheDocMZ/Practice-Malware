## ❗WARNING❗

Read this carefully before proceeding.

This repository contains live malware samples intended for educational purposes only. These samples are written to emulate common malware characteristics. These samples contain only private IP addresses and .local domains for any C2 callouts. They do not connect to any real world malicious C2 servers, however these samples should be handled with caution and treated as real malware as they can potentially cause damage to your system. 

- Do not download and/or execute these samples in an environment you do not own, or where you cannot revert to a saved state, such as a virtual machine. Practice safe malware handling procedures at all times!

I have created these samples to be utilized as a safe option for beginner level malware analysis/reverse engineering.  Please feel free to use them!
